# recall

recall is a Java Project that demonstrates a fully-working, software-based raycaster. It was inspired by retro games such as Wolfenstein, DOOM, and more. 

This project was written by me during my university studies a few years ago, but is now being ported to GitHub and refactored. This project was instrumental for me to get deeper into alogrithms and mathematics, and its usage in development. Some of the development practises were messy, but it taught me a lot. I'm also in the process of adding new features.


## Tech Stack

The project is fully written in pure Java, with a library and program called Greenfoot providing simple graphics and input functions. I've used their line and shape functions in order to draw on the screen, and the rest is written with pure maths like trigonometry.


## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository from GitHub.

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/jackjtaylor/recall
```

Download Greenfoot from https://www.greenfoot.org/download.

Open the project file with Greenfoot, and then start playing.


## Optimisations

The code has been written and refactored to meet formatting and performance standards.

The largest problem with performance, currently, is processing graphics on a higher-resolution display. As it's written in pure Java and without hardware acceleration, it can easily run on most computers, but at a higher resolution, can be quite intensive.
